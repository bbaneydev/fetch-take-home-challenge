My submission for the Fetch Take Home Test for Fetch Rewards -- 

The application is written in React and brings in data from an API using a GET request and submits data to an API through a POST request with user validation and also notifies the user that they have successfully submitted their form. 

The application uses React Hooks with useState and useEffect in order to manage data and in order to pass the data down to the child components as props. 
The application also uses React-Router-DOM in order to successfully and cleanly navigate through each page of the application. 
The <BrowserRouter> is set up in the Index.js file in order to just keep the App.js a little cleaner, while still giving react-router-dom access to the entire application in order to successfully navigate the site with Routes/Links.
